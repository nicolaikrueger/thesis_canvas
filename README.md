# Welcome to the Thesis Canvas

## What this project is about
Writing a scientific thesis is a tough endeavour. For many years, students were asked to start this journey with an exposé. I transformed this step into - as I believe - more user-friendly one, as working in a canvas became a modern and suitable form of expressing yourself, executing iterative brainstorming sessions and building a foundation for feedback loops with the supervisor.

## How to use the canvas
After downloading the canvas ([de](https://github.com/nicolaikrueger/thesis_canvas/blob/main/Thesis%20Design%20Canvas%20-%20DE.jpg) / [en](https://github.com/nicolaikrueger/thesis_canvas/blob/main/Thesis%20Design%20Canvas%20-%20EN.jpg)), you can add your text in a tool of your choice, might it be miro, murla, PowerPoint or any other tool. You even might print or plot it to work in a more handcrafted manner.

## The science behind
I am currently building proof, that students and supervisors might prefer this way of working (instead of the classical exposé path). You can support me in my research project, by answering my (2 min.) [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdF1RXTfCpxzwmU9sIjrX9ZBBSFxiNmaAkvTe7v-X1okSRhAg/viewform?usp=sf_link). Thank you in advance!

## Project roadmap
* Creating solid dataset of canvas users and supervisors
* Creating some noise on social media do get instant feedback
* Implementing the canvas for my students [done]
* Publishing scientific article
