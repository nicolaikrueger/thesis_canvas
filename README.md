# Welcome to the Thesis Canvas

## What This Project Is About
Writing a scientific thesis can be a challenging endeavor. Traditionally, students were asked to begin this journey with an exposé. I have transformed this initial step into what I believe to be a more user-friendly approach: working with a canvas. This modern method allows for a more iterative brainstorming process, better self-expression, and a solid foundation for continuous feedback loops with your supervisor.

## Supervision Process
I explain my thesis supervision best practices in this Instagram/TikTok videos with a [short Insta Reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-98RDWNE_B/) and a longer [TikTok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@nicolaikrueger/video/7405870738902666529).

## List of Topics
Find a list of potentially interesting topics in [this list](https://github.com/nicolaikrueger/thesis_canvas/blob/main/thesis_topics.md).

## How to Use the Canvas
After downloading the canvas ([DE](https://github.com/nicolaikrueger/thesis_canvas/blob/main/Thesis%20Design%20Canvas%20-%20DE.jpg) / [EN](https://github.com/nicolaikrueger/thesis_canvas/blob/main/Thesis%20Design%20Canvas%20-%20EN.jpg)), you can add your text using any tool of your choice, such as Miro, Mural, PowerPoint, or any other. You may even choose to print or plot it if you prefer a more hands-on approach.

## The Science Behind It
I am currently gathering evidence to support the idea that students and supervisors may prefer this method over the traditional exposé. You can contribute to my research by completing this short (2 min.) [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdF1RXTfCpxzwmU9sIjrX9ZBBSFxiNmaAkvTe7v-X1okSRhAg/viewform?usp=sf_link). Thank you in advance!

## Use GenAI to Refine Your Topic
It's good practice to challenge your research idea with AI before we start our discussion. Here’s an example of a sophisticated prompt you can use:

**German Prompt**
**Deutscher Prompt**
```
Agiere als Prof. Dr. Nicolai Krüger und kritisiere in seinem Stil mein Bachelorthesis-Exposé. Sei sehr kritisch-konstruktiv und gib mir konkrete Tipps. Stelle mir auch entsprechende Rückfragen, die mir helfen würden, mein Thema weiterzuentwickeln. Falls es nicht sofort klar wird, frag mich auch nach meinen genauen Studienvertiefungen und meiner Zielnote und passe Deine Rückmeldung entsprechend an.
```
**English Prompt**
```
Act as Prof. Dr. Nicolai Krüger and criticize my bachelor’s thesis exposé in his style. Be very critical and constructive, and give me specific tips. Also, ask me questions that would help me to develop my topic further. If it is not immediately clear, ask me about my exact study specializations and my target grade, and adjust your feedback accordingly.
```

## Project Roadmap
* Create a robust dataset of canvas users and supervisors [half way done]
* Generate some buzz on social media to gather immediate feedback [done]
* Implement the canvas for my students [done]
* Publish a scientific article
