# Open Topics for Bachelor/Master/PhD Theses

If you're passionate about cutting-edge research at the intersection of digital innovation, public administration, and applied AI, consider the following areas for your thesis. I invite you to reach out to discuss supervision opportunities. My expertise lies in guiding students from business disciplines with a strong digital/technical focus, as well as those in IT, information systems, and computer science with a concentration on applied AI and the implementation of AI services.

This document also includes topics previously offered at IU, serving as a source of inspiration for both current and former students. Explore these topics as a springboard for your academic journey.

**How to Use This Document**
My research interests stem from a blend of curiosity, interdisciplinary connections, and the pursuit of emerging trends. As such, this list encompasses topics at various stages of development, catering to students at different academic levels, from bachelor’s to PhD. Rather than a static catalog, consider this a living document—a starting point for discussions on how you might align your research with my ongoing work.

If you have no clue what you are looking at, start again in the [readme section](https://github.com/nicolaikrueger/thesis_canvas/tree/main) of this repo, especially the explanatory videos with a [short Insta Reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-98RDWNE_B/) and a longer [TikTok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@nicolaikrueger/video/7405870738902666529).
